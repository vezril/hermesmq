# structured-logging Specification

## Purpose

Emit machine-parseable JSON logs (in the container) using a constellation-wide field schema, so logs are queryable in Loki and consumable by the self-healing feedback loop without fragile regex — while local development keeps human-readable text. Log *format* only; no behavioural change.

## Requirements

### Requirement: JSON-structured logs in the container

The service SHALL emit each log event as a single-line JSON object when `LOG_FORMAT=json` (the default in its container image), carrying at least a timestamp, level, logger, thread, message, the `service` name, and — for errors — the exception's stack trace; MDC context SHALL appear as fields. In local development (no `LOG_FORMAT` override) it SHALL emit human-readable text instead.

#### Scenario: An error is emitted as parseable JSON
- **GIVEN** `LOG_FORMAT=json`
- **WHEN** the service logs an ERROR with an exception
- **THEN** the output is one JSON object with `level` = `ERROR`, the `service` name, the logger, the message, and a `stack_trace` field — extractable without regex over multi-line text

#### Scenario: Local development stays human-readable
- **GIVEN** no `LOG_FORMAT` is set
- **WHEN** the service logs
- **THEN** the console output is human-readable text

### Requirement: Constellation-wide log field schema

The JSON logs SHALL use the shared field shape so queries resolve identically across services: `@timestamp`, `level`, `logger_name`, `thread_name`, `message`, `service`, `stack_trace` (on error), and any MDC entries as top-level fields. On the JVM this SHALL be realized with `logstash-logback-encoder`, and the `service` field SHALL be `hermesmq`.

#### Scenario: Fields are consistent across services
- **GIVEN** two services' JSON logs
- **WHEN** they are queried in Loki by `service` and `level`
- **THEN** the same field names resolve in both — no per-service schema drift
